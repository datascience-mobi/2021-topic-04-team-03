    "Otsu Thresholding is a valuable method for detecting the ideal threshold of an image. It is therefore used frequently in\n",
    "image segmentation for biological and medical purposes. Here we are going to use the implementation of this algorithm\n",
    "for segmentation of cell nuclei from the datasets N2DH-GOWT1 and N2DL-HeLa cells of the cell tracking challenge and the\n",
    "NIH3T3 images of Coelho and colleagues in their challenge of nuclear segmentation in microscope cell images.\n",
    "For pre-processing the images, we used histogram stretching for images with low resolution, a gaussian filter,\n",
    "and a median filter as well as two-level Otsu thresholding for excluding reflections in some images. The implemented\n",

    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision, image segmentation is applied to a variety of challenges. These challenges include detecting\n",
    "cell sizes and the number of cells in high-throughput cytometry or for cell tracking as well as segmentation of\n",
    "brain images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges that need to be tackled in order to find the correct threshold for image segmentation are low contrast\n",
    "images, reflections and random noise that occur in the images. A starting point would be the preprocessing of the\n",
    "images before using the Otsu algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the algorithm can be evaluated using the dice score as well as the median surface distance\n",
    "function and the Hausdorff metric, that compare the segmented image to the hand-segmented ground truth image.\n",
    "Furthermore, to give a purpose to the segmented images, we implemented a cell counting algorithm to determine the\n",
    "number of cells in an image. In addition to the performance measurement of the algorithm, we visualise the results\n",
    "with an overlay of the segmented image and the ground truth image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "N2DH-GOWT1 cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset N2DH-GOWT1 of the cell tracking challenge (Bártová et al., 2011) contains images of GFP-GOWT1 mouse\n",
    "embryonic stem cells that have been derived with time-lapse confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS SP5 microscope.\n",
    "The varying brightness of the cells makes it hard to distinguish all the cells from the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "N2HL-HeLa cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset N2DL-HeLa of the cell tracking challenge (Neumann et al., 2010) contains images of human epithelial cells\n",
    "of cervical cancer. Those images have been derived with an Olympus IX81 microscope used for live imaging of\n",
    "fluorescently labelled chromosomes. The challenge in these images is the variety of brightness of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "NIH3T3 cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset NIH3T3 (Coelho et al., 2009) contains images of several mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. These images\n",
    "have also been derived with fluorescence microscopy images and the difficulty in segmenting these images mainly\n",
    "lies in the bright light spots, probably from the used microscope, that makes it difficult for the algorithm to choose\n",
    "a threshold between the brightness of the cells and the background and not between the brightness of light spots\n",
    "and the cells.\n",
