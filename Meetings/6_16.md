# Meeting Notes
**16.06.2021**

---

## Last week's progress
- Correct cell counting, overlay function
- Corrected other flaws
- Alternative function to deal with reflections
- wrote Introduction for the notebook

## Questions
- Is our error exception in Otsu better now? 
  Is it ok if we get a RuntimeWarning in Pycharm, but no error in Jupyter Notebook?
- Can we add saved images to Jupyter?
- Notebook: Should we also describe the methods (Otsu, Dice, etc.) again 
  or just the results we receive using those on our images?
- We have different intensity values for different images (0 to 255, 0 to 2**16, 0 to 1).
  Is that ok or should we rescale all the images?

## Plans for next week
- delete goodness, correct variable names (no capital letter), correct paths (/)
- np.errstate(divide = 'ignore')
- Update the test file (for tutorium) 
- Start with Jupyter Notebook
- Test combinations of functions on our images
- (2D Otsu, CLAHE ?)
