## Last week's progress
- code for histogram stretching
- pipeline assembly started
- started Gauss, median filter implementation
- added docstrings, better names for the variables, comments

## Questions
- How should our final code look like? 
  A single function that analyses all datasets? 
  Or can we analyse each dataset separately in Jupyter notebook?
- Do we need a separate file in the package for each function or is it ok the way it is now? 

## Plans for next week
- Finish Gauss, median filter (Hannah, Liza)
- Start to code for Hausdorff, MSD (Laura, Vero)
- Cell-counting algorithm (Hannah, Liza)
- (Implement reflection correction?) -> 2 level Otsu
