# Meeting Notes
**26.05.2021**

---

## Last week's progress
- code for Otsu's thresholding (4 codes)
  1. otsu
  2. otsu faster -> without a for loop
  3. otsuna -> alternative formula
  4. otsu_twolevel
    
- code for Dice Score 
  1. dice score
  2. dice faster
  3. IoU - for comparison

## Questions
- What is the good practice of commenting?
- Which functions from the libraries can we use? 
  For example, can we use Gauss filter from skimage?

## Plans for next week
- Implement Gauss filter, median filter -> reflect the border
- Implement histogram stretching
- Pipeline assembly
- (Implement reflection correction?)
- (Start with code for Hausdorff, MSD)
